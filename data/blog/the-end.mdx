## Topic Introduction:

Since this is the last day of group, it’s only fitting to talk about the last days and what position you are in for the afterlife.

## Opening Questions:

- How do you handle fear?
- How do you handle the delicacy of life itself?
- In what was does life carry meaning to you?
- What do you think happens when you die?

## Main talking points:

- Romans 3:23 - for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
- **Romans 6:23** – "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
- **John 11:25-26** – "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
- **Matthew 24:30-31** – "Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other."
- **1 Thessalonians 4:16-17** – "For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."

## Outro:

- **Revelation 21:1-4** – "Then I saw ‘a new heaven and a new earth,’ for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea... They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
- **1 John 5:11-12** – "And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life."
- Romans 10:9-10 - because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. **10** For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
