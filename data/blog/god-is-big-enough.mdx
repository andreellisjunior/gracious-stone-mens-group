## Topic Introduction:

Often, as men, whenever we run into issues or difficulties, it can be very frustrating because we just want to get it problem over with. We want to solve the issue on our own and almost never as for help. 

Surprisingly, God warns us about relying on our own strength…

## Opening Questions:

- Name a time in your life that something was very difficult.
- Name a time where you’ve felt like you could handle the problem at hand.
- Name another time where the problem at hand, quickly turned into a much bigger issue than you could have ever anticipated.

## Main talking points:

- Often we’ll find that when issues come up, we want to just solve it and get through it on our own.
- We’ve been given a gift as men to solve problems but if we find we keep running into the same issue, we’ve run out of strength to solve it.
- Here’s what happens when we try to do it on our own:
    - Jeremiah 17:5-6: 'This is what the Lord says: “Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans, who rely on human strength and turn their hearts away from the Lord . They are like stunted shrubs in the desert, with no hope for the future. They will live in the barren wilderness, in an uninhabited salty land. '
- Here’s the solution:
    - Jeremiah 17:7-8: '“But blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with roots that reach deep into the water. Such trees are not bothered by the heat or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they never stop producing fruit. '

## Outro:

- Psalms 139:7-10: 'I can never escape from your Spirit! I can never get away from your presence! If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I go down to the grave, you are there. If I ride the wings of the morning, if I dwell by the farthest oceans, even there your hand will guide me, and your strength will support me. '
- Isaiah 41:10: 'Don’t be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand. '
- Isaiah 40:12: 'Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance? '
