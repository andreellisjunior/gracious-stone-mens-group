## Topic Introduction:

Often, men are more intrigued by the things we can see. Most men are visual creatures, meaning we response and receive information visually.

Most times, this is used against us when it comes to the lusts of the eyes a.k.a. things we really want to look at or watch.

Seemingly good and definitely bad things can often become idols if unchecked.

What are some things we use our eyes for?

- Watching tv/movies
- Watching the family/kids play
- Watching out for trouble or keeping watch
- Watching videos online
- Reading books/articles/posts etc.

## Opening Questions:

- What are some things that grab your attention during a normal day? How do those things influence your thoughts or actions?
- How often do you find yourself drawn to something that you might feel like it’s not okay to see? What drives that urge?
- In what ways do you think our society uses visual media to capture our attention, for better or worse? How has this affected you as a man?
- With family/personal life, are you on guard with some of these things?
- What should we do then? What’s next for us as men in this visual world?

## Main talking points:

- **Proverbs 27:20:** ' Sheol and Abaddon [death and destruction] are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man. '
- **Matthew 5:27-28:** ' “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.'
- **Matthew 5:29:** 'If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. '
- **Proverbs 4:25-27:** ' Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you. Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure. Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.'

## Outro:

What do you think…Is your body governed by your eyes or is your eyes governed by your body?

- **Matthew 6:21-23:** 'Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be. “Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light. But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is! '
- **1 Corinthians 10:13:** 'No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. '
