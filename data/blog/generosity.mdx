## Topic Introduction:

'The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. As it is written, “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.” '

2 Corinthians 9:6-9

## Opening Questions:

- Name a time when someone gave you something that you didn’t expect?
- Name a person that you’ve gone to and after just about every interaction, you walk away feeling good/refreshed?
- Can someone say the same about you?

## Main talking points:

What God gives us isn’t 100% for us. It’s to give to others and our blessing is the byproduct of giving the gift to someone else.

## Outro:

The beginning of all of this is humility and prayer. Being humble enough to know you are not all that and pray to receive what God HAS for! You can’t just pick and choose what you want.
