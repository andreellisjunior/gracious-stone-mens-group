## **Topic Introduction:**

Humility and pride are two opposing forces that shape a man’s character, decisions, and relationships. Pride was the first sin, leading Satan to rebel against God (Isaiah 14:12-15) and Adam to fall in the garden (Genesis 3:4-6). On the other hand, humility is the path Jesus walked, leading to His exaltation (Philippians 2:5-11). As men, we face the constant temptation to live pridefully—trusting in our own strength, seeking our own glory, and resisting correction. But the Bible warns that pride leads to destruction, while humility leads to honor before God and others (Proverbs 16:18, James 4:6).

## **Opening Questions:**

1. How would you define humility and pride in your own words?
2. In what areas of life do men struggle with pride the most?
3. Can you think of a time when pride caused you to make a bad decision? What happened?
4. Why do you think humility is often seen as weakness in today’s culture?
5. What is one characteristic of a humble man that stands out to you?

## **Main Talking Points:**

### **1. The Danger of Pride**

- **Proverbs 16:18** – "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall."
- **James 4:6** – "But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.'"

### **2. Pride Comes Before the Fall**

- **Isaiah 14:12-15** – "How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.’ But you are brought down to Sheol, to the far reaches of the pit."
- **Genesis 3:4-6** – "But the serpent said to the woman, 'You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.' So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate."

### **3. The Call to Humility**

- **Philippians 2:3-4** – "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."
- **Colossians 3:12** – "Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience."

### **4. Jesus as the Ultimate Example of Humility**

- **Philippians 2:5-8** – "Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."
- **Matthew 11:29** – "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."

### **5. Humility Leads to Honor**

- **Proverbs 22:4** – "The reward for humility and fear of the Lord is riches and honor and life."
- **Luke 14:11** – "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."

### **6. Humility in Relationships and Leadership**

- **Ephesians 4:2** – "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love."
- **1 Peter 5:5-6** – "Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.' Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you."

### **7. Daily Practices to Cultivate Humility**

- **Micah 6:8** – "He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"
- **Romans 12:3** – "For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned."

## **Outro (Thought and Motion):**

- **Thought(prayer):** Ask God to identify areas in your life where pride has taken root—whether in your relationships, work, or faith. Ask Him to reveal any hidden pride in your heart.
- **Motion(action):** Practice humility in a specific way this week. This could be admitting a mistake, asking for forgiveness, listening more than speaking, serving someone without recognition, or encouraging someone else’s success instead of seeking your own.
