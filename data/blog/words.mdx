## Topic Introduction:

What are the 4 laws of gun safety?

- Treat every gun like it is load and always know the condition of your gun.
- Finger off the trigger unless the sights are aligned and the decision to shoot has been made.
- Never point a gun at anything you don’t intend to destroy.
- Know your target, what’s beyond it, in front of it, to the left and to the right of it.

## Opening Questions:

- Who likes/comfortable with guns?
- Tell me a time you’ve had a positive and a negative interaction with a gun.
- Now then, tell me about a time words have hit you like a bullet, positive or negative.

## Main talking points:

Proverbs 25:15 With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone.

Proverbs 16:24 Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.

Proverbs 12:18 The words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

Proverbs 13:3 The one who guards his mouth preserves his life; the one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin.

Proverbs 15:1 A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

## Outro:

Let’s make a conscious effort to be aware of our words.

Matthew 12:35-37 The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
