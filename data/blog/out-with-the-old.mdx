## Topic Introduction:

We need to be open to changing.

## Opening Questions:

Think of a time when you were somewhere is was just completely dirty. How did it make you feel? Could be your own house, someone else’s, public restroom.

how did it make you feel when you left or cleaned it?

## Main talking points:

We are definitely dirty people. In thought and motion. We can even create a dirty environment to those around us.

What are we gonna do about it?

What way have you noticed this?

Phillipians 4:6-7 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

Ephesians 4:22-24 To put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.

2 Corinthians 5:17 **Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature**: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

## Outro:

Ask someone important to you “is there something that you would like to see differently in me? Change a behavior, encourage something I’m already doing, etc.”
