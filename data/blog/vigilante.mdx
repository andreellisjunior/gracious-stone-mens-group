## Topic Introduction:

I was also thinking how you on safety have to be “vigilante” and how God ask us to be vigilante in our lives and for our families? Keeping watch and the important of it. Not being AFRAID, but being ALERT.

## Opening Questions:

How did you feel when you walked in a sketchy place?

How would you feel walking into that place and you have loved ones with you?

Do you ever feel like something or someone is out to get you?

## Main talking points:

**1 Peter 5:8-9 NLT:** Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.

## Outro:

Make sure you are paying attention to your surroundings. There are a lot of people depending on you to take care of them and keep them safe, not just physically but spiritually too.
