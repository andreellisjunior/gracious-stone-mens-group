## Topic Introduction:

Men are being attacked in SO many ways. It starts with young boys and all the way up to adults.

## Opening Questions:

- What is a man?
- What does it mean to be one?
- What does it mean to not be one?

## Main talking points:

(Some inspiration from [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6o6nZvY4q74pEYiFZwwqVs?si=96d688b486d04079))

- Manly men do manly things
  **(James 1:22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.)** - Get men focused on the doing. - Emotional responses are okay. However, it doesn’t stop there.
- Manly Men tend the field.
  (**1 Timothy 5:8 But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.)** - Keep in mind of what you are responsible for and what you are intended to do. Know this and know your field. - The opposite is irresponsibility.
- Manly Men build other men.
  (**Proverbs 27:17 Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.)** - When a man have a band of brothers, the manly man comes out in him in the most real and needed way. - There should be a free fire zone within that group of men. Whatever can be said as a means of encouragement and strengthening.
- Manly Men live for the glory of God
  **(John 15:4-5 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. "I am the vine, you *are* the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.)** - Can’t do it on his own because it’s impossible. - God’s strength is required
- Jesus is clearly the manliest man that ever was.
  - He has exemplified all of these points in one way or another.
    - He took care of his mom, listened to everyone’s concerns, knew what his mission was and never quit or stopped.
    - He was a craftsmen, he made everything with his hands. He took his work very serious
    - He had his circle. The men he trusted and loved to know the deep things before the world knew.
    - He consulted with his Father AT ALL TIMES! My goodness, he didn’t do anything the Father didn’t tell him to do.

## Outro:

- Jesus is the manliest man we’ve ever seen and he’s coming back soon in the most manliest way possible
  **(Revelation 19:11-16 11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war. 12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself. 13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God. 14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses. 15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress. 16 On his robe at his thigh[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A11-16&version=NLT#fen-NLT-30996a)] was written this title: King of all kings and Lord of all lords.)**
