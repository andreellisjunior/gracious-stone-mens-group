## Topic Introduction:

We are talking about prayer. This is by no means a deep dive in the technicalities of prayer but it’s intended to bring a new awareness to prayer and the impact it brings to our every day life.

## Opening Questions:

- How do you problem solve?
- Who where have talked to themselves? On purpose or on accident? What were those moments that you remembered enough to know you’ve done this?
- When you’ve done this, do you feel like something is listening to you? Maybe expect to be heard but feel like nothing is listening?

## Main talking points:

Prayer should be the foundation of every Christian endeavor. Even if you are not a christian, you have been invited to talk with God and ask questions. He’s safe enough to be skeptical and doubtful. He’s very patient with us.

## Outro:

- **Philippians 4:6** - "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."
- **Colossians 4:2** - "Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful."
- **1 John 5:14-15** - "This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him."
- **1 Thessalonians 5:16-18** - "Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus."
- **Matthew 6:5-13 -** “When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you. “When you pray, don’t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Don’t be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him! Pray like this: Our Father in heaven,
  may your name be kept holy.
  May your Kingdom come soon.
  May your will be done on earth,
  as it is in heaven.
  Give us today the food we need,
  and forgive us our sins,
  as we have forgiven those who sin against us.
  And don’t let us yield to temptation,
  but rescue us from the evil one.
