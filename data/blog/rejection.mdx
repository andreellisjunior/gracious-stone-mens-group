summary: 'How should we handle rejection as grown men? What does it mean to be rejected? How did Jesus handle rejection?'
---

## Topic Introduction:

The feeling of rejection is never talked about. How do we handle it? What should be done about? Where do we go from there?

These are big questions and ideas to explore and see how Jesus himself handled it and what we should expect.

## Opening Questions:

- How did/do you feel when people tell you no?
- What about when it’s extremely important?
- What goes through your head when you’ve been rejected?
- Do you handle “no” pretty well?
- How can you handle a healthy attachment?

## Main talking points:

- Isaiah 53:3 **He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.**
- John 1:11 **He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.**
- John 15:18 **“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.**

## Outro:

We see that Jesus was rejected but his rejection brings us life…

- Phil 4:19 **And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.**
- Romans 8:31 **What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?**
- Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 \*\*The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

- Theodore Roosevelt
