## **Topic Introduction:**

Many men today struggle with passivity—whether in their faith, relationships, work, or personal growth. Instead of leading, we shrink back. Instead of fighting for what matters, we avoid confrontation. This is not the life God has called men to live. From the beginning, passivity has been one of man’s greatest downfalls (**Genesis 3:6**), but Scripture calls us to step up, take action, and lead with courage.

## **Opening Questions:**

1. Have you ever avoided doing something you knew was right because it was easier to do nothing? What happened?
2. Why do you think many men today struggle with passivity?
3. What’s the difference between patience and passivity?
4. How do you think fear and insecurity contribute to passivity in men?
5. Who is a man you respect because he takes action instead of being passive? What sets him apart?

- **Genesis 3:6** – "So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate."

And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell."
- **Hebrews 12:1-2** – "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."

## Outro (Thought and Motion):

- **Thought(prayer):** Spend daily time in prayer, asking God to reveal areas of passivity in your own life and ask for direction. (faith, family, work, sin, relationships, etc.).
- **Motion(action):** Take an intentional step to fight passivity—whether it’s leading your family in prayer, having a hard conversation you’ve been avoiding, confessing a sin, etc.
