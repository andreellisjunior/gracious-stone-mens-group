## Topic Introduction

What does it truly mean to be a man? Society offers many definitions—some say it’s about power, wealth, or physical strength. Others believe masculinity is outdated or toxic. But what does God say? The Bible provides a clear, timeless blueprint for being a man who honors God, leads with love, and stands firm in faith.

## Opening Questions:

- Who were the male role models in your life growing up, and what did they teach you about being a man?
- How do you think society defines masculinity today?
- What qualities make a man truly strong? Are those qualities different from what the Bible teaches?
- If you could ask God one question about being a man, what would it be?

## Main talking points:

### **1. A Godly Man Seeks After God**

- A man’s first responsibility is to seek God above all else.
**Matthew 6:33** – 'But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. '
- Trusting in God, not just our own wisdom.
**Proverbs 3:5-6** – ' Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. '
- **Discussion:** What are some ways we can intentionally pursue God daily?

### **2. A Godly Man Leads with Love & Servanthood**

- True leadership is about serving, not controlling.
**Mark 10:42-45** –  'And Jesus called them to him and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” '
- **Ephesians 5:25** – Husbands are called to love their wives like Christ loves the church.
- **Discussion:** How can we lead our families, friends, and communities with humility?

### **3. A Godly Man Walks in Integrity**

- A righteous man keeps his word and speaks truth.
**Psalm 15:2-5** – 'He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord ; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.'
- **Discussion:** Where is integrity most tested in a man’s life today?

### **4. A Godly Man Protects and Provides**

- **1 Timothy 5:8** – Providing is about more than finances—it includes emotional and spiritual guidance.
- **Nehemiah 4:14** – Men are called to protect their families and communities.
- **Discussion:** In what ways can we be better protectors and providers, not just physically but spiritually?

### **5. A Godly Man Fights Against Sin & Stands for Truth**

- **2 Timothy 2:22** – Flee from temptation and pursue righteousness.
- **Ephesians 6:10-11** – Putting on the armor of God to stand firm.
- **Discussion:** What are some temptations or struggles that men face, and how can we overcome them?

### **6. A Godly Man Loves and Disciples Others**

- **Matthew 28:19-20** – The Great Commission calls us to disciple others.
- **Proverbs 27:17** – "Iron sharpens iron"—we need brotherhood and accountability.
- **Discussion:** Who is someone in your life that you can encourage or mentor?

- **Action Step:** Find one way to serve someone this week—your family, a friend, or a stranger.
