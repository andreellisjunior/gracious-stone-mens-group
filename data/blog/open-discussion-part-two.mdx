## Topic Introduction:

A very common theme during group was grace and truth. How do we balance the two? How do we show grace to others while still speaking truth?

## Scripture:

- **Matthew 18:15-17:**' â€œIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. '
