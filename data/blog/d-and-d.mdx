## **Topic Introduction:**

In Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), every player builds a character—complete with strengths, flaws, a backstory, and a mission. The players face monsters, challenges, and moral dilemmas, all while relying on dice rolls and their party to navigate the world.

Sounds a lot like life, right? Each of us is living out a story, walking through unpredictable terrain with both real enemies and internal struggles. But unlike D&D, where chance and the Dungeon Master control the game, **our lives are overseen by a sovereign God who is the Author of the story**. We’re not left to randomness—we're called to **walk by faith, not by sight** (2 Corinthians 5:7), and to fight spiritual battles as part of a kingdom far greater than fantasy.

This week, we’ll unpack the tension between control, wisdom, and faith in the “campaign” of life, and explore what it means to follow Jesus as both warrior and servant.

## **Opening Questions (Secular Start > Spiritual End):**

1. In D&D, your character can level up by gaining experience through trials and quests. What’s an area of your life where you’ve “leveled up” after going through something hard?
2. D&D often requires teamwork—you can’t win alone. Where in your real life do you see the importance (or the lack) of brotherhood or community?
3. Have you ever made a decision based purely on instinct or control that didn’t go well? What would it have looked like to act with wisdom and humility instead?
4. In the game, the Dungeon Master knows the whole story while you don’t. What does it feel like in real life to trust someone (or God) with the parts of your story you can’t see?
5. Why do you think we often try to “play god” in our own lives instead of following the real God?

## **Main Talking Points:**

### **1. Every Man Has a Character Sheet (Identity in Christ)**

- In D&D, you start with stats, a backstory, and a class. In life, we often try to define ourselves by our past, skills, or failures. But the Bible says our identity is in Christ.
- **2 Corinthians 5:17** – _“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”_
- **Ephesians 2:10** – _“For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”_

### **2. There’s a Battle Going On (Spiritual Warfare)**

- In the game, monsters lurk in dungeons. In real life, our enemies are not goblins but fear, temptation, and the lies of the enemy.
- **Ephesians 6:12** – _“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”_
- **1 Peter 5:8** – _“Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.”_

### **3. Wisdom is Better Than a Natural 20**

- In D&D, a natural 20 is the highest dice roll—a critical success. But in real life, success doesn’t come from luck. It comes from wisdom, prayer, and obedience.
- **Proverbs 3:5-6** – _“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.”_
- **James 1:5** – _“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.”_

---

### **4. The Party Matters (Brotherhood and Accountability)**

- You don’t win a campaign alone. The party watches your back, heals you when you’re down, and keeps you on mission.
- **Hebrews 10:24-25** – _“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.”_
- **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10** – _“Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!”_

### **5. The DM Knows the Whole Story (God’s Sovereignty)**

- In D&D, the Dungeon Master has planned the journey—even if the characters don’t know it. In life, God is our DM—but He isn’t guessing. He’s sovereign and good.
- **Romans 8:28** – _“And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”_
- **Psalm 139:16** – _“Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.”_

## **Outro: Thought & Motion**

**🧠 Thought (Prayer):**

Ask God to reveal attributes in your life that’s a lower level. Ask that He level you up.

**🛡️ Motion (Action Challenge):**

- This week, choose one “stat” to grow in: **Wisdom, Brotherhood, Prayer, or Surrender**.
- Find one brother in the group to text or check in with about that area. Don’t do the campaign alone.
- Bonus: Read Ephesians 6:10–18 and write out the “armor of God.” Which piece do you feel you’re missing right now?
