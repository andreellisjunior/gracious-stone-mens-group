## Topic Introduction:

This topic is based off of the Marvel evil character Thanos. If you’ve ever seen the Marvel movies, specifically the Infinity Saga, you’ll come across the big bad guy, Thanos. He’s described as a Titan. He’s someone that looks to destroy half the universe for the sake of saving the other half. Almost like an agenda of population control. 

However, what makes this a powerful message is throughout the movies, he’s showing a great sense of focus. A focus on the end goal if you will.

It was also brought up that there should be a balance between intentionality and obsession. We want to stick to our goals and mission but not become obsessive and miss out on other important things or relationships.

## Opening Questions:

- How many people watched the Marvel movies or and read the comics?
- Who’s your favorite character, good or bad?
- Are you familiar with Thanos? What about his mission?

## Main talking points:

- Thanos was so focused on the end goal, nothing else mattered.
- Thanos took his mission very serious. He even regulated his emotions during time of trial.
- What about our mission? What is our end goal?

## Outro:

- Proverbs 4:25 Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.
- Colossians 3:6 Set your mind on things above, not on earthly things.
- Matthew: 24:42 Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
- John 15:5 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.
- Hebrews 12:1-2 'Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. '
- Matthew 28:18-20 'And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”'
